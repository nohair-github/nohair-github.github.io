Set up an OpenBSD router/firewall from scratch on Protectli Vault (notes for FW4B and the later V1410)

Basic network diagram:

internet <-> [Router/firewall] <-> switch __ wifi access point
                                        |___ server(s)
										|___ wired hosts(s)

1. Install OpenBSD with GPT disks and UEFI boot
	a. Download install77.img and copy to USB drive using dd: dd if=~/Downloads/install77.img of=/dev/sd2 BS=1M
	b. Boot Vault into installer on USB drive. For, a step-by-step walk-through, see https://www.openbsdhandbook.com/installation/. It's a bit dated but is still mostly correct.
	c. First, do not choose '(I)nstall'; choose (S)shell. At this time the main HD will be sd0 and the USB sd1 (Vault FW4B and similar) or the main disk will be sd0, the eMMC sd1, and the USB sd2 (Vault V1410 and similar). You can check with 'dmesg' or 'sysctl hw.disknames'.
	d. Create an GPT disk with a new (EFI) partition:
		fdisk -i -g -b 960 sd0
	e. Now enter "install" to start installer.
	f. At select interface to configure, choose the first (either em0 or igc0) and select "autoconf'
	g. Then select second interface (em1 or igc1) and configure as lan interface:
		'inet 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0 10.1.1.255'
	h. When you get to the point where you are asked if you want to configure an addition user, do so. This will be your admin user after you disable root logins.
	i. In the next step where you are asked to allow root login on ssh, answer 'yes'. This is insecure but we will change this later. For now, it is useful after reboot for initial configuration.
	j. When you get to the point where the installer asks which disk to use, you can list the available disks.  Usually you will choose sd0 and then choose '(O)penBSD' partition. You can use the suggested disklabel or create a custom one (See Note A below) but don't touch slice 'i' - that's your EFI partition.
	k. When you get to the reboot question at the end, don't reboot. Select (S)hell again. Here, we install the bootloader on the EFI partition:
		Check where and which partitions are mounted.
			mount
		(Usually sd0a will be on /mnt and sd0i will need to be mounted on /mnt2)
		Run:
			/mnt/sbin/newfs_msdos sd0i (to format partition i - the EFI partition)
			mkdir /mnt2
			mount /dev/sd0i /mnt2
			mkdir -p /mnt2/efi/boot
			cp /mnt/usr/mdec/BOOTX64.EFI /mnt2/efi/boot/

	Now reboot then ssh back into new OpenBSD install as root for further configuration.

2. *** Now log in as root and set up serial console access (see Note B at end of this document). Do not proceed until that is working! ***
	
3. Adjust user permissions: If you configured a second user during install, you need to configure that (non-root admin) user to have root privileges as needed. If not, create the second user. Then:

	a. Add second user to wheel group
		vi /etc/group
		Change 'wheel:*:0:root' to 'wheel:*:0:root,second_user'

	Or (perhaps better):
		
	b. Simply add admin permissions to second user in doas.conf:
		# Allow wheel by default
		permit keepenv :wheel as root
		
		# Allow root
		permit nopass keepenv root as root
		
		# Allow second_user
		permit persist keepenv second_user as root
		
	c. Now log out of your ssh session and re-login as second_user to check if you have access and that you can use doas to escalate privileges as needed.
		ssh -l second_user 10.1.1.1
	   Once logged in:
	   	doas less /etc/pf.conf
	
4. SSH with private keys: After you confirm you can log in as a non-root user
	
	a. Create ssh key on your computer you use to log into the Vault:
		ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com" (preferred)
		(Or, for older systems but less secure:
		ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com")
		Set passphrase and save private key as .ssh/id_ed25519 and public key as .ssh/id_ed25519.pub
		
	b. Optional: Then add to ssh-agent and use that for key management
		Reference: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

	c. Copy public key to .ssh/authorized_keys on Vault (assuming an ip address of 10.1.1.1)
	    scp /home/second_user/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub second_user@10.1.1.1:/home/second_user/.ssh/
		Then log into the vault and
		cat .ssh/id_ed25519.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys
		(or use ssh-agent)
		
	d. Now test by logging out and logging in to see if you are prompted for the passphrase of your key.
	
	e. If you're sure it's working, insert the following lines to /etc/ssh/sshd_config below the default entries. This will lock the root out from ssh and lock you out as well if private key authentication is not working. In that case, I hope you got serial console access working; otherwise, time to re-install from sratch.
	
		ListenAddress 10.1.1.1
		PermitRootLogin no (this locks out root login)
		PasswordAuthentication no (this allows only public/private key logins)
		PubkeyAuthentication yes
		
	f. Restart sshd
		doas rcctl restart sshd
	
	f. If you're locked out, well, see the end of this document for how to do serial console access.
	
5. If not already done, configure basic network WAN and LAN interfaces.
	em0 or igc0:
		'inet autoconf'
	em1 or igc1:
 		'inet 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0 10.1.1.255'	
	
6. dhcpleased.conf:
	interface igc0 {
        ignore dns
        }		
		
7. sysctl.conf:
	net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
	
8. Preliminary pf configuration
	pf.conf:
		wan = "igc0" # egress
		lan  = "igc1"
		set block-policy drop
		set loginterface egress
		set skip on lo0
		block all
		pass out on egress inet from $lan:network to !($lan:network) nat-to (egress:0)
		pass in on $lan inet from $lan:network
		pass out on $lan inet		

9. DHCP
	a. Example dhcpd.conf
		# DHCP server options.
		# See dhcpd.conf(5) and dhcpd(8) for more information.
		#
	
		# Network:              10.1.1.0/255.255.255.0
		# Domain name:          example.internal
		# Name servers:         10.1.1.53 10.1.1.1
		# Default router:       10.1.1.1
		# DHCP address range:   10.1.1.100 - 10.1.1.199
	
		# Global parameters
		option  domain-name "example.internal";
	
		subnet 10.1.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	        range 10.1.1.100 10.1.1.199;
	        option broadcast-address 10.1.1.255;
	        option routers 10.1.1.1;
	        option  domain-name-servers 10.1.1.53, 10.1.1.1;
	        option ntp-servers 10.1.1.1; 
	        max-lease-time 86400;
	        default-lease-time 43200;
	
	        host Roku4KStick {
	                hardware ethernet 50:06:f5:4a:7c:1e;
	                fixed-address 10.1.1.200;
	                }
	
	        }

	b. Create log files:
		doas touch /var/log/dhcpd.log
		doas chown root:wheel /var/log/dhcpd.log
		doas chmod 640 /var/log/dhcpd.log

	c. Add stanza to syslog.conf to redirect logging to dhcpd.log
		# Divert dhcpd logs to /var/log/dhcpd.log
		!!dhcpd
		*.*                                                     /var/log/dhcpd.log
		!*
		#

	d. Edit newsyslog.conf to set number of log files retained
		/var/log/dhcpd.log                      640  4     250  *     Z


10. DNS: Unbound
	Unbound is configured as a caching and forwarding DNS server which is configured to communicate with 
	the forwarders over DOT.

	Create log files:
		doas touch /var/log/unbound.log
		doas chown root:wheel /var/log/unbound.log
		doas chmod 640 /var/log/unbound.log

	Configure newsyslog.conf:
		/var/log/dhcpd.log                      640  4     250  *     Z

	Now:
		doas rcctl enable unbound
		doas rcctl start unbound

11. DNS: Install adblocking with unbound-adblock (https://geoghegan.ca/unbound-adblock.html)

12. pf-badhost et al.
	For the internet facing devices, blocking by ip addresses of potentially nefarious hosts is done. Pf-badhost (https://geoghegan.ca/pfbadhost.html) is used along with blocking 'blackhats' and 'cumulative_persistent_threats' which are local blocklists created by scraping the http and relayd logs.

13. More extensive pf configuration according to your network.

		Configure wg0:
			nano /etc/hostname.wg0
			
			inet 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.252
			up
			!/usr/local/bin/wg setconf wg0 /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf

		Add to pf.conf:
		
			# Wireguard vpn
			vpn_if="wg0"
			vpn_port="21266"
			
			# WireGuard
			pass on $vpn_if
			pass in inet proto udp from any to any port $vpn_port
			pass out on egress inet from ($vpn_if:network) nat-to (egress:0)
					
17. ddclient.conf
	You can use ddclient to set the ip address of a FQDN and then use that in wg0.conf to maintain the wireguard tunnel even if the ip addresses assigned by you ISP change:
	
		Create a DNS record on your provider for client.example.network. Here, I am using Cloudflare:
	
		# ddclient.conf
		
		daemon=10800                            # check every 10800 seconds (3 hr)
		syslog=yes                              # log update msgs to syslog
		mail=admin_user                             # mail all msgs to admin
		mail-failure=admin_user                     # mail failed update msgs to admin
		pid=/var/run/ddclient/ddclient.pid      # record PID in file.
		ssl=yes                                 # use ssl-support.  Works with
		                                        # ssl-library
		# postscript=script                     # run script after updating.  The
		                                        # new IP is added as argument.
		
		##
		## Find current ip address of external interface
		## using if
		
		use=if, if=em0
		
		##
		## Change ip address for example.network and client.example.network
		## at CloudFlare (www.cloudflare.com).
		## This works but is less secure as it uses global API key.
		## However, ddclient 3.9.1 is the package for OpenBSD which seems only to support
		## global key. To use a more secure token with only Zone-DNS-Edit and
		## Zone-Zone-Read permissions you need to download the source, compile and install
		## a more up-to-date release.
		##
		
		protocol=cloudflare, \
		zone=example.network, \
		ttl=1, \
		login=yournamw@email.com, \
		password=676XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1122cc \
		example.network 
		client.example.network
		
	For the server, create a subdomain on your Cloudflare DNS records and
	use a similar ddclient.conf with a different last line
	
		server.example.network
		
18. newsyslog.conf
	As noted above, remember to add these:
		
		/var/log/unbound.log                    640  7     250  *     Z
		/var/log/dhcpd.log                      640  4     250  *     Z
		/var/log/unbound-adblock/unbound-adblock.log    _adblock:wheel  640  1     250  *     Z
		
19. syslog.conf:
	Insert a similar stanza at the top of syslog.conf to divert logging of a process from syslog to a specific process log. To do this for unbound and dhcpd (above):
	
		# Divert unbound logs to /var/log/unbound.log
		!!unbound
		*.*                                       /var/log/unbound.log
		!*
		#
	If you set up unbound to log to unbound.log in unbound.conf as described above, this change is not needed.

20. Setting up mail alerts for admin user:
	Edit /etc/mail/aliases
		vi /etc/mail/aliases
	Under 'Well-known alaises'
		# Well-known aliases -- these should be filled in!
		root: second_user
		manager: root
		dumper: root

	Afterward. remember to run 'doas newalaises'


Note A: Considerations for OpenBSD partition sizes:
	It's fine to use the suggested partition/disklabels as a starting point, but
	1. If the system will be used for more that 6 months and be upgraded to new releases as they appear, you need at least 1.1G free in /usr. Comsider bumping /usr up several GB.
	2. If you plan to install significant amounts of software outside of the base system, consider a separate /usr/local.
	3. If you don't plan to build custom kernels or from the ports tree, /usr/src and /usr/obj can be small or even eliminated and this space re-allocated to /usr
	4. Consider the V1410 which has 32GB on an eMMC chip. This could be used as /altroot. If so, then your base system (/, /etc, /usr, /tmp, /var, /usr/X11R6 and so on, excluding /home, /opt, /usr/local, etc.) would need to be limited to 32GB. That's still plenty. /home and other partitions can be on a separate partition.
	5. You can leave free space at the end of the disklabels which can be later used to add new mount points (like /usr/local, /var/log, /opt, etc.) or to expand /home.


Note B: Setting up serial port/com:
	FW4B and related:
		Edit /etc/ttys to include:
			console "/usr/libexec/getty std.115200" vt220 on secure
		Edit /etc/boot.conf:
			set tty com0
			stty com0 115200
		Connect com RJ45 to DB9 cable [and, depending on your computer, to null modem cable (optional) and DB9 to USB-A cable].
		Command to connect in terminal session:
		    sudo cu -l /dev/cu.usbserial-A507G86A  -s 115200
		    Actual line will vary; query with 'ls -al /dev | grep usb'
		Reboot and you should see the output of the bootloader and the OpenBSD boot.
		Login as 'root' with the root password
		Command to disconnect:
			'~.'
			
	V1410 and related:
		Edit /etc/ttys to include:
			tty00 "/usr/libexec/getty std.115200" vt220 on secure
		Edit /etc/boot.conf:
			set tty com0
			stty com0 115200
		Connect USB-C to USB-A serial cable
		Command to connect:
			screen /dev/tty.usbserial-FT5GE3UP 115200
			Actual line will vary; query with 'ls -al /dev | grep usb'
			(Note - cu doesn't work for some reason)
		Reboot and you should see the output of the bootloader and the OpenBSD boot.
		Login as 'root' with the root password
		Command to disconnect and quit:
			'CTRL-A' ':' then enter 'quit' or
			'CTRL-A' 'D' 'D'.
			(should usually avoid 'CTRL-A' 'CTRL-/')
